## How To Run The Project

```
$ git clone <git_url>
```

```
$ cd MedCircle
```

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ node server
```

go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in browser


### Technologies Used:

ReactJS

NodeJS/ExpressJS for the server

Hotmodule Reloading for live changes

Webpack for compilation etc.

JQuery for the networking library (I would have used fetch but it's still unsuppoeted on IE)

React Router for Single Page Application

### What I Accomplished

My solution hits everything mentioned on the design doc––including mobile responsiveness and a "unique and creative" way to browse the articles (using a little Modal preview)

### Time Elapsed

Roughly 4 hours (10:30pm - 2:20am)
